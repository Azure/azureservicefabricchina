By using Service Fabric, developers and administrators can avoid solving complex infrastructure problems and focus instead on implementing mission-critical, demanding workloads knowing that they are scalable, reliable, and manageable. Service Fabric represents the next-generation middleware
platform for building and managing these enterprise-class, Tier-1 cloud-scale applications.

Service fabric is coming up with completely different architecture.As PaaS V2, service fabric will run on top of Virtual Machines (ARM based) and host customer application by distributed computing cluster, by that pattern, backend incident like VM outage and customer operation like application upgrade will ideally cause 0 data loss and not impact real time transaction at all.
